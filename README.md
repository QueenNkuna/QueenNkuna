## Project Overview <a class="anchor" id="Project-overview"></a>
The vegetable market in India is a complex ecosystem influenced by factors such as regional variations, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, and overall supply and demand. This project seeks to unravel the intricacies of vegetable pricing dynamics in  India. We will utilize a comprehensive dataset and the power of Python programming tools to gain valuable insights into the elements driving price changes across different regions and throughout the year.

Our analysis will employ a data-driven methodology. We will begin by meticulously cleaning and preparing the dataset for exploration.  Visualizations such as histograms and boxplots will help us understand the distribution of vegetable prices,  identifying patterns and potential outliers. Further investigation will delve into regional price disparities and seasonal trends affecting the vegetable market.

## Packages <a class="anchor" id="Packages"></a>
We used the following packages and more to carry out the objectives for our repository:
+ `Pandas 2.2.2` and `Numpy 1.26`
+ `Matplotlib 3.8.4`
  
## Environment <a class="anchor" id="Environment"></a>
### This is how we created our environment:

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.

bash

Copy code

cd path/to/your/project/directory

**Install virtualenv (Optional):**

If you haven't installed virtualenv yet, you can do so using pip:

Copy code

pip install virtualenv

**Create the Virtual Environment:**

Once you're in the project directory, run the following command to create a virtual environment named "env" (you can replace "env" with any name you prefer):
bash

Copy code

virtualenv env

**Activate the Virtual Environment:**

Depending on your operating system, use the appropriate command to activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:

bash

Copy code

.\env\Scripts\activate

**On macOS/Linux:**

bash

Copy code

source env/bin/activate

**Install Required Packages:**


With the virtual environment activated, you can now install any required Python packages using pip. For example:
Copy code

pip install package1 package2

**Project:**

We were then able to work on our project. Any packages you install or scripts you run will only affect the virtual environment, keeping your system Python environment clean.

**Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional):**

When you're done working on your project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running the deactivate command:

Copy code

deactivate
